## 2026-11-01 — Keep concurrent sessions out of each other's checkout

Two agent sessions worked in the main checkout (`work/rauserBrowser`) at once.
One switched to `chore/panel-drop-redundant-status` and committed while the
other ran `git checkout -b`, so the new branch stacked on the first session's
commit and moved that session's HEAD; untangling it took a cherry-pick onto
`origin/main` and a manual branch restore. The main checkout is also the live
install, so a `cargo build` or `cargo test` there replaces the running
`target/debug/brauser`. Change: have `scripts/dev/worktree-hygiene` (or a new
`scripts/dev/start-branch`) create every new branch as a worktree from
`origin/main`, and refuse `checkout`/`switch` in the main checkout when its HEAD
is not `main` or another session's branch is checked out there. Where: the
"PR ownership and handoff" section of AGENTS.md and `scripts/dev/`.
